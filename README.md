# AlexaCare
AlexaCare is a HackHarvard Hackathon project that aims to provide a hands free, direct-response, analytic tracking call bell for health care facilities.

# How Does It Work?

First a patients amazon account is associated with an echo. Secondly the patient may be registered through the administration panel, under the care of a specific nurse.
A patient can say "Alexa, my care" to hear the menu available, or more importantly "Alexa, I need help", or "Alexa, can you call my nurse?",  or any similar phrase that would
invoke the request of a nurse.

Then a push notification is sent to the corresponding nurses mobile device, where he/she can be alerted and click to respond to the patients call.

Analytics track information like, average response time, and calls per patients which are aimed to help recognie and reduce inefficiencies/issues
within a given health care facility.

# Is it still in the works?

It actually is! This hackathon project was made for a person in mind. The entire codebase will soon be refactored, (much of it is rushed hackathon code).
But hopefully it will be a polished application soon!
